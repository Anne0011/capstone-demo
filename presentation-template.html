          Project Goals:
        </h3>

        With my project I was aiming to provide a community curated database for:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Locals to post and share startup companies and their details
          </li>
          <li>
            Collect and provide information on investors
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly identify places to work
          </li>
          <li>
            Post jobs that need to be filled, and interesting news
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill a need not currently well served in the Nashville startup community (distribution of information)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h3>
          Lessons Learned:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To break things constantly is part of coding and iterating
          </li>
          <li>
            Spacing and formatting matters if you want other people to help you (aka my son)
          </li>
          <li>
            Learned more about using git collabortively
          </li>
          <li>
            Always keep coding, even when you feel like it's too hard
          </li>
          <li>
            It takes time to learn to code, it comes from scar tissue and repitition
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you begin, you should definitely whiteboard and plan the structure of your app before starting
          </li>
        </ul>
